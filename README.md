# GitHub Actions for Terraform Deployment  
This repository contains a GitHub Actions workflow to deploy AWS infrastructure using Terraform Modules From Any GitHub Repository.


🚀 Simplifying Cloud Infrastructure Deployment with Terraform & GitHub Actions 🌐
I recently used Terraform in a multi-repo, multi-module setup integrated with GitHub Actions to deploy scalable infrastructure on AWS. 

💡 What We Built
   ✅ EC2 Instances
   ✅ Auto Scaling Groups
   ✅ VPC with multiple subnets

💡 Why Multi-Repo, Multi-Module?

   🔸 Scalability: Enables separate teams to manage and deploy different components independently.
   🔸 Reusability: Modular Terraform code promotes reusability and consistency across projects.
   🔸 CI/CD Integration: GitHub Actions automates validations, testing, and deployment.

💡 Key Highlights
   🔹 Terraform Modules: Separate modules for VPC, subnets, EC2, and Auto Scaling—stored in individual repositories for easy version control and reuse.
   🔹 GitHub Actions Workflow: Automatically validates Terraform configuration, performs security checks, and applies infrastructure changes seamlessly.
   🔹 Scalable Design: Auto Scaling ensures that the infrastructure adapts dynamically to varying workloads.

This setup empowers teams to deploy, manage, and scale cloud infrastructure effortlessly while adhering to DevOps best practices.
